The primary goal of this project is to exercise the JEE 6 platform without using
other dependency injection frameworks, such as Spring. Other technologies can be
used.

The application analyses your music library and provides statistics. The library
file must be in a supported format.

The main points of interests are:
	* CDI (JSR 299),
	* JPA 2.0 (JSR 317),
	* and JBoss Seam.
It is extremely important that all parts of code are unit or integration tested.

Requirements for building:
	* Maven 3,
	* VTD installed in the local m2 repository.
At the moment of writing this document VTD was not available from Maven
repositories, so it must be downloaded and installed manually. It can be
obtained from here: http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/

Requirements for running:
	* JBoss 7 AS,
	* MySQL 5.
A different configuration has not been tested.

Note on building with integration tests:
By default (e.g. mvn clean install) basic integration tests that use in memory
HSQLDB will run.More comprehensive tests will run if `integration` parameter is
set (e.g. mvn clean install -Dintegration). That requires a MySQL database
running with a schema called audiolicious_test.

Note on JBoss 7 AS data source configuration:
Define data source in standalone.xml.

Set transaction timeout to 3600.
